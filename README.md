## My process

### Built with

Plain old HTML and CSS, but using both flex and grid.

As the desktop layout is slightly more complex it's desktop first with @media for mobile. But both were designed in parallel.

### What I learned

I haven't used grid that much in my practice to date, so this was a good opportunity to play around with positioning of grid items.
I also found flex very useful to position the icons.

### Continued development

I took the opportunity to make my own side design, stealing some assets from the Pokemon website!
